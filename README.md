# Functional-connectivity-brain-network-using-Networkx-and-MNE
This project provides a general pipline to obtain and analyse brain connectivity network using python libs like networkx and MNE.
This was made by me as a part of my research internship project where i studied the literature on use of graph theory to understand brain networks. 
I hope this code serves as a good starting point for any relavent project one might undertake.
